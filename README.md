pchain
---------

Orchestrate promise chains.

## series

```javascript
var chain = pchain.series(call1, call2);
chain('some arg').then(success).catch(fail);
```

The code assumes that ```call1``` and ```call2``` are functions
that return a promise. ```pchain.series``` will return a function
that, when called, returns a promise.

```call1``` will be passed the arguments from the chain call,
in this case ```'some arg'```. When the ```call1``` promise
resolves, the result will be passed as arguments into ```call2```.

When ```call2``` resolves, the result will be passed as arguments
into the ```success``` function.

When any call rejects, then execution chain will stop and the
```fail``` function will recieve the error.

## parallel

```javascript
var chain = pchain.parallel(call1, call2);
chain('some arg').then(success).catch(fail);
```

The code assumes that ```call1``` and ```call2``` are functions
that return a promise. ```pchain.parallel``` will return a function
that, when called, returns a promise.

```call1``` and ```call2`` will be passed the arguments from the
chain call,`in this case ```'some arg'```. When the ```call1``` and
```call2``` promises are resolved, the result will be passed as
an array into ```success```.

If ```call1``` or ```call2``` rejects, the ```fail``` function will
recieve the first error.

## combinations

### verbose

```javascript
var chain = pchain.series(call1, pchain.parallel(call2, call3), call4);
chain('foo').then(success).catch(fail);
```

```call1``` is called with ```'foo'```, ```call2``` and ```call3```
are then called with the result from ```call1```, ```call4``` is
called with an array of the results from ```call2``` and ```call3```
and, finally, ```success``` is called with the result of ```call4```.

### simplified

The call above can be written simpler using arrays of functions:

```javascript
var chain = pchain.series(call1, [call2, call3], call4);
chain('foo').then(success).catch(fail);
```

...or even simpler:

```javascript
var chain = pchain(call1, [call2, call3], call4);
chain('foo').then(success).catch(fail);
```
